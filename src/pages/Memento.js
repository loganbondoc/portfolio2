        <h2>"Young people often experience post-event effects of nostalgia, emptiness and social fatigue. These feelings are exacerbated by common tendencies to suppress emotions or to be productive in the aftermath of these events.
            Despite the abundance of post-event recovery methods, there is still an existing struggle to debrief and preserve memories from events."</h2>
